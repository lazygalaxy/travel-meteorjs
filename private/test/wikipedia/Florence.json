According to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', it was politically, economically, and culturally one of the most important cities in Europe and the world from the 14th to 16th centuries.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\nThe language spoken in the city during the 14th century was, and still is, accepted as the [[Italian language]]. Almost all the writers and poets in Italian literature of the ''golden age'' are in some way connected with Florence, leading ultimately to the adoption of the Florentine dialect, above all the local dialects, as a literary language of choice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://italian.about.com/library/weekly/aa060699a.htm |title=History of the Italian Language |publisher=italian.about.com |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nStarting from the late Middle Ages, Florentine money\u2014in the form of the gold [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]\u2014financed the development of industry all over Europe, from Britain to Bruges, to Lyon and Hungary. Florentine bankers financed the English kings during the [[Hundred Years War]]. They similarly financed the papacy, including the construction of their [[Avignon Papacy|provisional capital of Avignon]] and, after their return to Rome, the reconstruction and Renaissance embellishment of Rome.\n\nFlorence was home to the Medici, one of history's most important noble families. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] was considered a political and cultural mastermind of Italy in the late 15th century. Two members of the family were [[pope]]s in the early 16th century: [[Leo X]] and [[Clement VII]]. [[Catherine de Medici]] married king Henry II of France and, after his death in 1559, reigned as regent in France. The Medici reigned as [[Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], starting with [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] in 1569 and ending with the death of [[Gian Gastone de' Medici]] in 1737.\n\n===Roman origins===\nThe [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] initially formed a small settlement in 200&nbsp;BC as the settlement of Fiesole (Faesulae in Latin),<ref>http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/florence/history</ref> which was destroyed by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in 80&nbsp;BC in reprisal for supporting the [[populares]] faction in Rome. The present city of Florence was established by [[Julius Caesar]] in 59&nbsp;BC as a settlement for his veteran soldiers and was named originally ''Fluentia'', owing to the fact that it was built between two rivers, which was later changed to ''Florentia''.<ref>Leonardo Bruni, ''History of the Florentine People'' I.1, 3</ref> It was built in the style of an [[Military camp|army camp]] with the main streets, the ''[[cardo]]'' and the ''[[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]]'', intersecting at the present ''[[Piazza della Repubblica (Florence)|Piazza della Repubblica]]''. Situated at the ''[[Via Cassia]]'', the main route between Rome and the north, and within the fertile valley of the [[Arno]], the settlement quickly became an important commercial centre.\n\nIn centuries to come, the city experienced turbulent periods of [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] rule, during which the city was often troubled by warfare between the [[Ostrogoths]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], which may have caused the population to fall to as few as 1,000 people. Peace returned under [[Lombards|Lombard]] rule in the 6th century. Florence was conquered by [[Charlemagne]] in 774 and became part of the Duchy of Tuscany, with [[Lucca]] as capital. The population began to grow again and commerce prospered. In 854, Florence and [[Fiesole]] were united in one county.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n===Second millennium===\nMargrave Hugo chose Florence as his residency instead of [[Lucca]] at about 1000&nbsp;AD. The [[Golden Age]] of Florentine art began around this time. In 1013, construction began on the Basilica di San Miniato al Monte. The exterior of the [[Florence Baptistery|baptistery]] was reworked in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] between 1059, and 1128. This period also saw the eclipse of Florence's formerly powerful rival [[Pisa]] (defeated by [[Genoa]] in 1284 and subjugated by Florence in 1406), and the exercise of power by the [[mercantilism|mercantile]] elite following an anti-aristocratic movement, led by Giano della Bella, that resulted in a set of laws called the [[Ordinances of Justice]] (1293).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n===Middle Ages and Renaissance===\n{{Main|Republic of Florence|Italian Renaissance}}\n\n====Rise of the Medici====\n[[File:Leonardo da Vinci01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] statue outside the [[Uffizi Gallery]]]]\n\nOf a population estimated at 94,000 before the [[Black Death]] of 1348,<ref>\"[http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plague/ Decameron Web, Boccaccio, Plague]\". Brown University.</ref> about 25,000 are said to have been supported by the city's [[wool]] industry: in 1345 Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool combers (''ciompi''), who in 1378 rose up in a brief revolt against oligarchic rule in the [[Ciompi|Revolt of the Ciompi]]. After their suppression, Florence came under the sway (1382\u20131434) of the [[House of Albizzi|Albizzi]] family, bitter rivals of the Medici.\n\nIn the 15th century, Florence was among the largest cities in Europe, considered rich and economically successful. Life was not idyllic for all residents though, among whom there were great disparities in wealth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pallanti, Giuseppe|title=Mona Lisa Revealed: The True Identity of Leonardo's Model|year=2006|publisher=Skira|location=Florence, Italy|pages=17, 23, 24|isbn=88-7624-659-2}}</ref> [[Cosimo de' Medici]] was the first Medici family member to essentially control the city from behind the scenes. Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts, his power came from a vast [[patronage]] network along with his alliance to the new immigrants, the ''gente nuova'' (new people). The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their ascendancy. Cosimo was succeeded by his son [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero]], who was, soon after, succeeded by Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo in 1469. Lorenzo was a great patron of the arts, commissioning works by [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]. Lorenzo was an accomplished musician and brought composers and singers to Florence, including [[Alexander Agricola]], [[Johannes Ghiselin]], and [[Heinrich Isaac]]. By contemporary Florentines (and since), he was known as \"Lorenzo the Magnificent\" (Lorenzo il Magnifico).\n\nFollowing Lorenzo de' Medici's death in 1492, he was succeeded by his son Piero&nbsp;II. When the French king [[Charles VIII of France|Charles&nbsp;VIII]] invaded [[northern Italy]], Piero&nbsp;II chose to resist his army. But when he realized the size of the [[French Army|French army]] at the gates of Pisa, he had to accept the humiliating conditions of the French king. These made the Florentines rebel and they expelled Piero&nbsp;II. With his exile in 1494, the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government.\n\n====Savonarola and Machiavelli====\n[[File:Hanging and burning of Girolamo Savonarola in Florence.jpg|thumb|left|Girolamo Savonarola being burnt at the stake in 1498]]\nDuring this period, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] [[Girolamo Savonarola]] had become [[prior]] of the San Marco monastery in 1490. He was famed for his penitential sermons, lambasting what he viewed as widespread immorality and attachment to material riches. He blamed the exile of the Medicis as the work of God, punishing them for their decadence. He seized the opportunity to carry through political reforms leading to a more democratic rule. But when Savonarola publicly accused [[Pope Alexander VI]] of corruption, he was banned from [[public speaking|speaking in public]]. When he broke this ban, he was excommunicated. The Florentines, tired of his extreme teachings, turned against him and arrested him. He was convicted as a heretic and [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] on the [[Piazza della Signoria]] on 23 May 1498.\n\nA second individual of unusually acute insight was [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], whose prescriptions for Florence's regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimization of political expediency and even malpractice. In other words, Machiavelli was a sort of political thinker, perhaps most renowned for his political handbook, titled [[The Prince]], which is about ruling and the exercise of power. Commissioned by the Medici, Machiavelli also wrote the [[Florentine Histories]], the history of the city. Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established a republic on 16 May 1527. Restored twice with the support of both Emperor and Pope, the Medici in 1537 became hereditary dukes of Florence, and in 1569 [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], ruling for two centuries. In all Tuscany, only the Republic of Lucca (later a [[Duchy of Lucca|Duchy]]) and the Principality of [[Piombino]] were independent from Florence.\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n[[File:Wenceslaus Werlin 001.jpg|thumb|[[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his family. Leopold was, from 1765 to 1790, the [[Grand duke|Grand Duke]] of Tuscany]]\nThe extinction of the Medici dynasty and the accession in 1737 of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], [[Lorraine (duchy)|duke of Lorraine]] and husband of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], led to Tuscany's temporary inclusion in the territories of the Austrian crown. It became a [[secundogeniture]] of the [[House of Lorraine|Habsburg-Lorraine]] dynasty, who were deposed for the [[House of Bourbon-Parma]] in 1801, themselves deposed in December 1807 when Tuscany was annexed by France. Florence was the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the French d\u00e9partement of [[Arno (department)|Arno]] from 1808 to the fall of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] in 1814. The Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was restored on the throne of Tuscany at the [[Congress of Vienna]] but finally deposed in 1859. Tuscany became a region of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.\n\nFlorence replaced [[Turin]] as Italy's capital in 1865 and, in an effort to modernise the city, the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses. The Piazza (first renamed Piazza [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emmanuele&nbsp;II]], then [[Piazza della Repubblica (Florence)|Piazza della Repubblica]], the present name) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end. This development was unpopular and was prevented from continuing by the efforts of several British and American people living in the city.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today.\n\nThe country's second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later, after the withdrawal of the French troops made its addition to the kingdom possible.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:SanMiniatoAlMonte-Cimetiere.jpg|thumb|300px|''Porte Sante'' cemetery, burial place of notable figures of Florentine history.]]\nAfter doubling during the 19th century, Florence's population was to triple in the 20th, resulting from growth in tourism, trade, [[financial services]] and industry.\n\nDuring World War II the city experienced a year-long German occupation (1943\u20131944) and was declared an [[open city]]. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers who died driving the Germans from Tuscany are buried in cemeteries outside the city (Americans about {{convert|9|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} south of the city, British and Commonwealth soldiers a few kilometres east of the centre on the right bank of the Arno). In 1944, the retreating Germans demolished the bridges along the [[Arno]] linking the district of Oltrarno to the rest of the city, making it difficult for the [[British Army|British troops]] to cross. However, at the last moment Charle Steinhauslin, at the time consulate of 26 countries in Florence, convinced the German general in Italy that the [[Ponte Vecchio]] was not to be destroyed due to its historical value.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nInstead, an equally historic area of streets directly to the south of the bridge, including part of the [[Vasari Corridor|Corridoio Vasariano]], was destroyed using mines. Since then the bridges have been restored to their original forms using as many of the remaining materials as possible, but the buildings surrounding the Ponte Vecchio have been rebuilt in a style combining the old with modern design. Shortly before leaving Florence, as they knew that they would soon have to retreat, the Germans executed many [[freedom fighter]]s and political opponents publicly, in streets and squares including the Piazza Santo Spirito.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nAt the end of [[World War II in Europe]], in May 1945, the U.S. Army's Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilized American service men and women in Florence, Italy. The first American University for service personnel was established in June 1945 at the School of Aeronautics in Florence, Italy. Some 7,500 soldier-students were to pass through the University during its four one-month sessions (see [[G. I. American Universities]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://giuniversity.wordpress.com/florence/ |title=University Study Center, Florence \u00ab The GI University Project |publisher=Giuniversity.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1966, the [[1966 Flood of the River Arno in Florence|Arno flooded]] parts of the centre, damaging many art treasures. Around the city there are tiny placards on the walls noting where the flood waters reached at their highest point.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Florence_view_from_Piazzale_Michelangelo_-_Florence,_Italy_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|500px|November 2005 city view in the Arno's valley, in the background the Apennine mountains]]\nFlorence lies in a basin formed by the hills of [[Villa Medici at Careggi|Careggi]], [[Fiesole]], [[Settignano]], [[Arcetri]], [[Poggio Imperiale]] and Bellosguardo (Florence).

The executive body is the City Committee (''Giunta Comunale''), composed by 7 [[Assessor (Italy)|assessors]], that is nominated and presieded over by a directly elected [[List of mayors of Florence|Mayor]]. The current mayor of Florence is [[Dario Nardella]].\n\nThe municipality of Florence is subdivided into five administrative Boroughs (''Quartieri''). Each Borough is governed by a Council (''Consiglio'') and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organization is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The Boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous founding in order to finance local activities. The Boroughs are:\n* Historic Centre; population: 67,170;\n* [[Campo di Marte]]; population: 88,588;\n* Gavinana-[[Galluzzo]]; population: 40,907;\n* Isolotto-[[Legnaia]]; population: 66,636;\n* Rifredi; population: 103,761.\n\nAll of the five boroughs are governed by the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]].\n\nThe current Italian Prime Minister, [[Matteo Renzi]], served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.\n\n==Main sights==\n{{Main|Architecture of Florence}}\n[[File:Florence Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Florence Cathedral]]\n[[File:Palazzo Vecchio by nigth.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Palazzo Vecchio]], Florence landmark.]]\n[[File:Ponte Vecchio.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Vecchio]], which spans the [[Arno river]]]]\nFlorence is known as the \"cradle of the Renaissance\" (''la culla del Rinascimento'') for its monuments, churches, and buildings. The best-known site of Florence is the domed cathedral of the city, [[Florence Cathedral|Santa Maria del Fiore]], known as ''The Duomo'', whose dome was built by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. The nearby [[Campanile]] (partly designed by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]) and the [[Baptistery of Florence Cathedral|Baptistery]] buildings are also highlights. The dome, 600 years after its completion, is still the largest dome built in brick and mortar in the world.<ref>Ross King, ''Brunelleschi's Dome, The Story of the great Cathedral of Florence'', Penguin, 2001</ref> In 1982, the '''[[Historic Centre of Florence|historic centre of Florence]]''' (Italian: ''centro storico di Firenze'') was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by the [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Historic Centre of Florence \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/174|website = whc.unesco.org|accessdate = 2015-07-08|first = UNESCO|last = Centre}}</ref> The centre of the city is contained in [[Defensive wall|medieval walls]] that were built in the 14th century to defend the city. At the heart of the city, in [[Piazza della Signoria]], is [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]]'s [[Fountain of Neptune, Florence|Fountain of Neptune]] (1563\u20131565), which is a masterpiece of [[marble sculpture]] at the terminus of a still functioning Roman [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]].\n\nThe layout and structure of Florence in many ways harkens back to the Roman era, where it was designed as a [[garrison]] settlement.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> Nevertheless, the majority of the city was built during the Renaissance.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> Despite the strong presence of Renaissance architecture within the city, traces of [[medieval architecture|medieval]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[modern architecture]] can be found. The [[Palazzo Vecchio]] as well as the Duomo, or the city's Cathedral, are the two buildings which dominate Florence's skyline.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\nThe River Arno, which cuts through the old part of the city, is as much a character in Florentine history as many of the people who lived there. Historically, the locals have had a love-hate relationship with the Arno \u2013 which alternated between nourishing the city with commerce, and destroying it by flood.\n[[File:Firenze-Florenz-Florence JBU01.jpg|thumb|Florence at night from Piazzale Michelangelo]]\n\nOne of the bridges in particular stands out \u2014 the Ponte Vecchio (''Old Bridge''), whose most striking feature is the multitude of shops built upon its edges, held up by stilts. The bridge also carries [[Vasari Corridor|Vasari's elevated corridor]] linking the Uffizi to the Medici residence ([[Palazzo Pitti]]). Although the original bridge was constructed by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], the current bridge was rebuilt in the 14th century. It is the only bridge in the city to have survived World War&nbsp;II intact. It is the first example in the western world of a bridge built using segmental [[arch]]es, that is, arches less than a semicircle, to reduce both span-to-rise ratio and the numbers of pillars to allow lesser encumbrance in the riverbed (being in this much more successful than the Roman [[Alcon\u00e9tar Bridge]]).\n\n[[File:Vechio.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Santa Trinita]] with the [[Oltrarno]] district]]\nThe church of [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] contains the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|Medici Chapel]], the [[mausoleum]] of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]]\u2014the most powerful family in Florence from the 15th to the 18th century. Nearby is the Uffizi Gallery, one of the finest art museums in the world \u2013 founded on a large bequest from the last member of the Medici family.\n[[File:Florence Duomo from Michelangelo hill.jpg|thumbnail|left|Florence Duomo as seen from Michelangelo hill.]]\nThe Uffizi is located at the corner of [[Piazza della Signoria]], a site important for being the centre of Florence's civil life and government for centuries. The [[Palazzo della Signoria]] facing it is still home of the municipal government. The [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] provided the setting for all the public ceremonies of the republican government. Many significant episodes in the [[history of art]] and political changes were staged here, such as:\n* In 1301, [[Dante Alighieri]] was sent into exile from here (commemorated by a plaque on one of the walls of the Uffizi).\n* On 26 April 1478, Jacopo de' Pazzi and his retainers tried to raise the city against the Medici after the plot known as ''The congiura dei Pazzi'' (''[[Pazzi conspiracy|The Pazzi conspiracy]]''), murdering [[Giuliano de' Medici (1453\u20131478)|Giuliano di Piero de' Medici]] and wounding his brother Lorenzo. All the members of the plot who could be apprehended were seized by the Florentines and hanged from the windows of the palace.\n* In 1497, it was the location of the [[Bonfire of the Vanities]] instigated by the Dominican friar and preacher [[Girolamo Savonarola]]\n* On 23 May 1498, the same Savonarola and two followers were hanged and burnt at the stake. (A round plate in the ground marks the spot where he was hanged)\n* In 1504, [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's David]] (now replaced by a replica, since the original was moved in 1873 to the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]]) was installed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as Palazzo Vecchio).\n\nThe Piazza della Signoria is the location of a number of statues by other sculptors such as [[Donatello]], [[Giambologna]], Ammannati and [[Benvenuto Cellini|Cellini]], although some have been replaced with copies to preserve the originals.\n\n===Monuments, museums and religious buildings===\n{{see also|List of churches in Florence|Theatres in Florence}}\n[[File:Florenz Uffizien.jpg|thumb|upright|Piazzale degli Uffizi]]\nFlorence contains several palaces and buildings from various eras. The Palazzo Vecchio is the [[City and town halls|town hall]] of Florence and also an art museum. This large [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Battlement|crenellated]] fortress-palace overlooks the [[Piazza della Signoria]] with its copy of Michelangelo's David statue as well the gallery of statues in the adjacent [[Loggia dei Lanzi]]. Originally called the ''Palazzo della Signoria'', after the [[Signoria of Florence]], the ruling body of the [[Republic of Florence]], it was also given several other names: ''Palazzo del Popolo'', ''Palazzo dei Priori'', and ''Palazzo Ducale'', in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke's residence was moved across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti. It is linked to the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti through the [[Corridoio Vasariano]].\n\n[[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]], designed by [[Michelozzo|Michelozzo di Bartolomeo]] for [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo il Vecchio]], of the Medici family, is another major edifice, and was built between 1445 and 1460. It was well known for its stone masonry that includes rustication and ashlar. Today it is the head office of the Metropolitan City of Florence  and hosts museums and the [[Biblioteca Riccardiana|Riccardiana Library]]. The [[Palazzo Strozzi]], an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone, was inspired by the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Palazzo Medici]], but with more harmonious proportions. Today the palace is used for international expositions like the annual antique show (founded as the Biennale del'Antiquariato in 1959), fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events. Here also is the seat of the Istituto Nazionale del Rinascimento and the noted [[Gabinetto Vieusseux]], with the library and reading room. Aside from these palaces and buildings, there are several others, including the [[Palazzo Rucellai]], designed by Leon Battista Alberti between 1446 and 1451 and executed, at least in part, by [[Bernardo Rossellino]]; the [[Palazzo Davanzati]], which houses the museum of the Old Florentine House; the [[Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali (Florence)|Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali]], designed in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style in 1871; the [[Palazzo Spini Feroni]], in [[Piazza Santa Trinita]], a historic 13th-century private palace, owned since the 1920s by shoe-designer [[Salvatore Ferragamo]]; as well as various others, including the Palazzo Borghese, the Palazzo di Bianca Cappello, the [[Palazzo Antinori]], and the Royal building of Santa Maria Novella.\n[[File:Palazzo Pitti Gartenfassade Florenz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Pitti]] on [[Boboli Gardens]]' side]]\nFlorence contains numerous museums and art galleries where some of the world's most important works of art are held.

The oldest literary pieces written in vernacular language go as far back as the 13th century. Florence's literature fully blossomed in the 14th century, when not only Dante with his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (1306\u20131321) and Petrarch, but also poets such as [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and [[Lapo Gianni]] composed their most important works.<ref name=\"florenceholidays.com\"/> Dante's masterpiece is the ''Divine Comedy'', which mainly deals with the poet himself taking an allegoric and moral tour of Hell, Purgatory and finally Heaven, during which he meets numerous mythological or real characters of his age or before. He is first guided by the Roman poet [[Virgil]], whose non-Christian beliefs damned him to Hell. Later on he is joined by [[Divine Comedy|Beatrice]], who guides him through Heaven.<ref name=\"florenceholidays.com\"/>\n\nIn the 14th century, [[Petrarch]]<ref name=\"florenceholidays\">{{cite web|url=http://www.florenceholidays.com/florence-vacation-literature-in-florence-petrarch-boccaccio.html |title=Literature in Florence \u2013 Petrarch and Boccaccio, Florentine Writers and Poet: Petrarch and Boccaccio |publisher=Florenceholidays.com |accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]<ref name=\"florenceholidays\" /> led the literary scene in Florence after Dante's death in 1321. Petrarch was an all-rounder writer, author and poet, but was particularly known for his ''[[Il Canzoniere|Canzoniere]]'', or the Book of Songs, where he conveyed his unremitting love for Laura.<ref name=\"florenceholidays\" /> His style of writing has since become known as ''Petrarchism''.<ref name=\"florenceholidays\" /> Boccaccio was better known for his ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]'', a slightly grim story of Florence during the 1350s bubonic plague, known as the [[Black Death]], when some people fled the ravaged city to an isolated country mansion, and spent their time there recounting stories and novellas taken from the medieval and contemporary tradition. All of this is written in a series of 100 distinct novellas.<ref name=\"florenceholidays\" />\n\nIn the 16th century, during the Renaissance, Florence was the hometown of political writer and philosopher Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, whose ideas on how rulers should govern the land, detailed in ''The Prince'', spread across European courts and enjoyed enduring popularity for centuries. These principles became known as ''[[Machiavellianism]]''.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Florence}}\n{{See also|Music of Tuscany}}\nFlorence became a musical centre during the [[Middle Ages]] and music and the performing arts remain an important part of its culture. During the Renaissance there were four kinds of musical patronage in the city with respect to both sacred and secular music: state, corporate, church, and private.<ref>'Frank D'Accone, Lorenzo il Magnifico and Music', in ''Lorenzo il Magnifico e il suo mondo.

The city is home to renowned Italian actors and actresses, such as [[Roberto Benigni]], [[Leonardo Pieraccioni]] and [[Vittoria Puccini]].\n\n===Cuisine===\nFlorentine food grows out of a tradition of peasant eating rather than rarefied high cooking. The majority of dishes are based on meat. The whole animal was traditionally eaten; [[tripe]] (''trippa'') and stomach (''[[lampredotto]]'') were once regularly on the menu and still are sold at the food carts stationed throughout the city. [[Antipasto|Antipasti]] include ''crostini toscani'', sliced bread rounds topped with a chicken liver-based [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]], and sliced meats (mainly [[prosciutto]] and [[salame]], often served with melon when in season). The typically saltless Tuscan bread, obtained with natural [[levain]] frequently features in Florentine courses, especially in its soups, ''[[ribollita]]'' and ''[[pappa al pomodoro]]'', or in the salad of bread and fresh vegetables called ''[[panzanella]]'' that is served in summer.

Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East. It was a map drawn by the Florentine [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]], a student of Brunelleschi, that [[Christopher Columbus]] used to sell his \"enterprise\" to the Spanish monarchs, and which he used on his first voyage. Mercator's \"Projection\" is a refined version of Toscanelli's \u2013 taking into account the Americas, of which the Florentine was, obviously, ignorant.\n\nGalileo and other scientists pioneered the study of optics, ballistics, astronomy, anatomy, and so on.

Florence's main upscale shopping street is [[Via de' Tornabuoni]], where major luxury fashion houses and jewelry labels, such as [[Armani]] and [[Bulgari]], have their elegant boutiques.

The cart is connected by a rope to the interior of the church. Near the cart there is a model of a dove, which, according to legend, is a symbol of good luck for the city: at the end of the Easter mass, the dove emerges from the nave of the Duomo and ignites the fireworks on the cart.\n\n====''Calcio Storico''====\n[[File:Calcio Storico Corteo.jpg|thumb|Calcio Storico]]\n{{See also|Calcio Fiorentino}}\n\n''Calcio Storico Fiorentino'' (\"Historic Florentine [[Association football|Football]]\"), sometimes called ''Calcio in costume'', is a traditional sport, regarded as a forerunner of soccer, though the actual gameplay most closely resembles rugby. The event originates from the [[Middle Ages]], when the most important Florentine nobles amused themselves playing while wearing bright costumes. The most important match was played on 17 February 1530, during the [[Siege of Florence (1529\u20131530)|siege of Florence]]. That day [[Papal States|Papal troops]] besieged the city while the Florentines, with contempt of the enemies, decided to play the game notwithstanding the situation. The game is played in the Piazza di [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]]. A temporary arena is constructed, with bleachers and a sand-covered playing field. A series of matches are held between four teams representing each ''quartiere ''(quarter) of Florence during late June and early July.<ref>[http://www.calciostorico.it/ Calcio Storico Fiorentino (Official site)] {{it icon}}</ref> There are four teams: Azzurri (light blue), Bianchi (white), Rossi (red) and Verdi (green).

Individual tickets, or a pass called the Carta Agile with multiple rides (10, 21 or 35), may be used on ATAF&Li-nea buses, Tramvia, and 2nd class local trains but only within city railway stations. Once on the bus, tickets must be stamped (or swiped for the Carta Agile) using the machines on board, unlike train tickets which must be validated before boarding. The main bus station is next to Santa Maria Novella [[railway station]]. [[Trenitalia]] runs trains between the railway stations within the city, and to other destinations around Italy and Europe. The central railway station, [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella railway station]], is located about {{convert|500|m|ft}} northwest of the Piazza del Duomo. There are two other important stations: Campo Di Marte and Rifredi. Most bundled routes are Firenze\u2014Pisa, Firenze\u2014Viareggio and Firenze-Arezzo (along the main line to Rome). Other local railways connect Florence with [[Borgo San Lorenzo]] in the Mugello area (Faentina railway) and [[Siena]].\n\nLong distance {{convert|10|km|2|abbr=on}} buses are run by the SITA, Copit, CAP companies. The transit companies also accommodate travellers from the Amerigo Vespucci Airport, which is {{convert|5|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} west of the city centre, and which has scheduled services run by major European carriers.\n\nThe centre of the city is closed to through-traffic, although buses, taxis and residents with appropriate permits are allowed in. This area is commonly referred to as the ZTL (''Zona Traffico Limitato''), which is divided into five subsections. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Residents of one section, therefore, will only be able to drive in their district and perhaps some surrounding ones. Cars without permits are allowed to enter after 7.30&nbsp;pm, or before 7.30&nbsp;am. The rules shift during the tourist-filled summers, putting more restrictions on where one can get in and out.\n\nIn an effort to reduce air pollution and car traffic in the city, a multi-line tram network called ''Tramvia'' is under construction. The first line began operation on 14 February 2010 and connects Florence's primary intercity railway station ([[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella]]) with the southwestern suburb of [[Scandicci]]. This line is {{convert|7.4|km|1|abbr=on}} long and has 14 stops. The construction of a second line began on 5 November 2011, construction was stopped due to contractors' difficulties but should restart in a few months, completion is now previewed in 2017. This second line will connect Florence's airport with the city centre. A third line (from [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella]] to the Careggi area, where are the most important hospitals of Florence) has gained governmental approval, its construction will follow the second line's timeline.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arriva La Tramvia (in Italian)|url=http://www.gestramvia.it/home.html|publisher=GEST|accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.firenze.it/opencms/export/sites/retecivica/amm/piani_e_progetti/Tramvia.html |title=Tramvia \u2013 Il Sistema Tramviario Fiorentino |accessdate=11 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202152941/http://www.comune.firenze.it/opencms/export/sites/retecivica/amm/piani_e_progetti/Tramvia.html |archivedate=2 February 2012 }}, Tramvia page of Florence's city government web site (in Italian).</ref><ref>[[Trams in Florence]], Wikipedia article \"Florence tramway\"</ref>\n\n===Railway station===\n[[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station]] is the main national and international railway station in Florence and is used by 59&nbsp;million people every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandistazioni.it/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=84db47db3c09a110VgnVCM1000003f16f90aRCRD |title=Grandi Stazioni \u2013 Firenze S.
